        <p>Whichever way you look at it, in the decade and a half since its release, Boards Of Canada’s Warp debut has
          acquired a mythical prestige that transcends both the Sandison brothers’ original ambitions and the music’s
          own guileless outlook. Perhaps surprisingly for a record so fanatically adored, not even all the material
          on Music Has The Right To Children was new: ‘Turquoise Hexagon Sun’ had appeared on Hi Scores in 1996
          and on the collection Boc Maxima (released on the pair’s Music70 label), which also included ‘One Very
          Important Thought’, ‘Roygbiv’ and ‘Wildlife Analysis’. But where that record pulled together Boards Of
          Canada ephemera into a musically pleasing if conceptually underwhelming whole, Music Has The Right To
          Children was a unified work proper.
        </p>
        <p>Despite its name, Music… is about as grown-up as records get: an adult meditation on childhood, concerned with
          play, naïveté and nostalgia, all tinted with rosy pastoralism. But it’s also devilishly subtle, intricate and
          emotionally mature. That’s surprisingly rare in electronic music, most of which is concerned with the
          physicality of dance, intellectual weight, or the evocation of atmosphere rather than a holistic experience.
          By introducing themes of suppression, solitude and grief into Music…’s evocations of childhood, Boards of Canada
          created a record that was pretty but seldom precious, more faithful to experience than kitsch idealism.
          This ambiguity has endeared Music Has The Right To Children to its hordes of fans over time: as its listeners
          grew ever further away from the childhood it evoked, the album, bizarrely, became more relevant.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s tempting to paint Music Has The Right to Children as a dazzling innovation, but it’s simply not true.”
        </p>
        <p>Track names like ‘Pete Standing Alone’ and ‘Happy Cycling’ contain obvious markers of the childhood conceit, but
          so do titles more centred on learning, like ‘Roygbiv’ (the acronym for the colours of the rainbow) and ‘Triangles
          and Rhombuses’. Tracks like these illuminate what, if any one thing, Music… is ‘about’: the fragility of the zone
          between innocence and experience, instinct and learning, blissful ignorance and the weight of knowledge. But it’s
          Music Has The Right To Children’s allusiveness — its palette of submerged samples that hint at unspoken memories
          rather than spelling them out — that’s proven to be its most enduring quality.
        </p>
        <p>Music Has The Right To Children’s formula is essentially very simple: yearning melodies and a subtle attention to
          texture and timbre. Those melodies still capable of bringing a lump to the throat, from the piano in ‘Olson’ to
          the synth passage in ‘Bocuma’; these moments, informed by the TV and film tunes that shaped the Sandison brothers’
          youth, are pregnant with yearning. Similarly, that rich textural detail lends itself wonderfully to intimate
          headphone listening – take the bubbling, liquid synth line of ‘Turqoiuse Hexagon Sun’, set against the faintest
          breath of tape hiss, or the pastoral twinkle of bird sounds in ‘Rue The Whirl’, the result of days spent editing
          and processing field recordings of birds outside the brothers’ studio. The instrumental and concrète samples are
          artificially antiqued, a dusty golden patina retrospectively applied, rendering new recordings at once aged and ageless.
